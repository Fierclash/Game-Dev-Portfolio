			Here is a quick monologue.

			There’s no feeling more intense than starting over. If you deleted your homework the day before it was due, as I have, or if you left your wallet at home and you have to go back after spending an hour in the commute. If you won some money at the casino, and then put all your winnings on red, but it came up black. If you got your best shirt dry-cleaned before a wedding, but then immediately dropped food on it. If you won an argument with a friend and then later discovered that they just returned to their original view, starting over is harder than starting up.

			If you’re not ready for that, like you’ve already had a bad day, then what you’re about to go through might be too much. Feel free to go away and come back. I’ll be here.

			Alright, thanks for coming with me on this trip. I’ll understand if you have to take a break at any point. Just find a safe place to stop, and quit the game. Don’t worry, I’ll save your progress- always. Even your mistakes.

			This game is an homage to a game that came out in 2002 titled “Sexy Hiking”. The author of that game was Jazzuo, a mysterious Czech designer who was known at the time as the father of b-games… and b-games are rough assemblages of found objects. Designers slap them together very quickly and freely, and they’re often too rough and unfriendly to gain much of a following. They’re built more for the joy of building them than as polished products. In a certain way Sexy Hiking is the perfect embodiment of a b-game. It’s built almost entirely out of found and recycled parts, and it’s one of the most unusual and unfriendly games of its time. In it, your task is to simply drag yourself up a mountain with a hammer. That act of climbing, in the digital world or in real life has certain essential properties that give the game its flavor. No amount of forward progress is guaranteed: some cliffs are too sheer or too slippery, and the player is constantly, unremittingly in danger of falling and losing everything.

			Anyway when you start Sexy Hiking, you’re standing next to this dead tree that blocks the way to the entire rest of the game. It might take you an hour to get over that tree, and a lot of people never got past it. You prod and you poke at it, exploring the limits of your reach and your strength, trying to find a way up and over, and there’s a sense of truth in that lack of compromise. Most obstacles in video game worlds are fake: you can be completely confident in your ability to get through them once you have the correct method, or the correct equipment, or just by spending enough time. In that sense, every pixellated obstacle in Sexy Hiking is real.

			The obstacles in Sexy Hiking are unyielding, and that makes the game uniquely frustrating, but I’m not sure Jazzuo intended to make a frustrating game. The frustration is just essential to the act of climbing, and it’s authentic to the process of building a game about climbing.

			A funny thing happened to me as I was building this mountain. I’d have an idea for a new obstacle, and I’d build it- test it- and it would usually turn out to be unreasonably hard… but I couldn’t bring myself to make it easier. It already felt like my inability to get past a new obstacle was my fault as a player, rather than as a builder. Imaginary mountains build themselves from our efforts to climb them, and it’s our repeated attempts to reach the summit that turns those mountains into something real.

			When you’re building a video game world, you’re building with ideas, and that can be like working with quick-set cement. You mold your ideas into a certain shape that can be played with, and in the process of playing with them they begin to harden and set until they’re immutable like rock, and at that point you can’t change the world- not without breaking it into pieces and starting fresh with new ideas.

			For years now, people have been predicting that games would soon be made out of pre-fabricated objects; bought in a store and assembled into a world, and for the most part that hasn’t happened, because the objects in the stores are trash. I don’t mean that they look bad, or that they’re badly made- although a lot of them are- I mean they’re trash in the way that food becomes trash as soon as you put it in the sink. Things are made to be consumed and used in a certain context, and once the moment is gone they transform into garbage. In the context of technology, those moments pass by in seconds.

			Over time, we’ve poured more and more refuse into this vast digital landfill that we call the internet. It now vastly outnumbers and outweighs the things that are fresh, and untainted, and unused. When everything around us is cultural trash, trash becomes the new medium- the lingua franca of the digital age- and you can build culture out of trash, but only trash culture: b-games, b-movies, b-music, b-philosophy. Maybe this is what digital culture is. A monstrous mountain of trash, the ash-heap of creativity’s fountain. A landfill with everything we ever thought of in it. Grand, infinite, and unsorted.

			There’s 3D models of breakfast. Gen Xer’s fanfic novels. Scanned magazines, green-screen Shia Laboeuf, banned snuff scenes on Liveleak. Facebook’s got lifelike bots with unbranded adverts and candid shots of Kanye and Taylor Swift mashups- car crash epic fail .gifs, Russian dashcam vids, discussions of McRibs! Discarded, forgotten, unrecycled. Muddled, rotten, untitled.

			Everything’s fresh for about six seconds- until some newer thing beckons- and we hit refresh, and there’s years of perservering disappearing into the pile; out of style, out of sight. In this context, it’s tempting to make friendly content that’s gentle- that lets you churn through it but not earn it. Why make something demanding if it just gets piled up in the landfill, filed in with the bland things?

			When games were new, they wanted a lot from you; daunting you, taunting you, resetting and delaying you. Players played stoically. Now everyone’s turned off by that. They wanna burn through it quickly; a quick fix for the fickle, some tricks for the clicks of the feckless… but that’s not you, you’re an acrobat. You could swallow a baseball bat.

			Now I know, most likely you’re watching this on Youtube or Twitch while some dude with 10 million views does it for you, like a baby bird being chewed-up food. That’s culture too.

			But on the off-chance that you’re playing this, what I’m saying is: trash is disposable, but maybe it doesn’t have to be approachable. What’s the feeling like? Are you stressed? I guess you don’t hate it if you got this far, feeling frustrated- it’s underrated. An orange is sweet juicy fruit locked inside a bitter peel. That’s not how I feel about a challenge. I only want the bitterness. It’s coffee, it’s grapefruit, it’s licorice.

			It feels like we’re closer now, composer and climber, designer and user. You could have refused, but you didn’t. There was something in you that was hidden that chose to continue. It means a lot to me that you’ve come this far, endured this much, every wisecrack, every insensitivity. Every setback you’ve forgiven me is a kingly gift that you’ve given me.

			We have the same taste, you and I. It’s not ambition, it’s ambition’s opposite. An obdurate mission to taste defeat. You’ll feel bad if you win, so I put this snake in for you. Have you thought about who you are in this? Are you the man in the pot, Diogenes? Are you his hand? Are you the top of his hammer? I think not. Where your hand moves, the hammer may not follow… nor the man, nor the man’s hand. In this you’re his will. His intent. The embodied resolve in his uphill ascent.

			Now, you’ve conquered the ice cliff. The platforms, the church, and the rectory. The living room and the factory. The playground and the construction site. The granite rocks and the lakeside. You’ve learned to hike.

			There’s no way left to go but up, and in a moment I’ll shut up, but let me say: I’m glad you came.

			I dedicate this game to you, the one who came this far. I give it to you with all my love.
